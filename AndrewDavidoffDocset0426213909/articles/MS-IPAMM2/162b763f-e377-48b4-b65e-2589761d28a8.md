<p>The following figure shows the state machine of the
IIpamEnumeratorCallback server port type.</p>

<p><b>Figure 5: IIpamEnumeratorCallback state machine</b></p>

<p>The IIpamEnumeratorCallback server is session-based, sharing
the same session the management client has with the management server using the
IIpamEnumerator port type. It is also stateful in nature. The <b>session state</b>
variable is used to keep track of the current state for each session and it can
have the following states as possible values. At any point of the session, if
the session is known to be faulted or closed by the lower layer, the state
machine ends.</p>

<table>
 <thead>
 <tr>
 <th>
 <p>State</p>

 <th>
 <p>Description</p>

 <tr>
 <td>
 <p>Enumeration Callback Initialized</p>
 </td>
 <td>
 <p>This is the initial state of the
 IIpamEnumeratorCallback when it has been initialized by the IIpamEnumerator
 client.</p>
 <p>When the NotifyEnumerationStart is received in this
 state from the IIpamEnumerator server port on the management server-end of
 the session, the transition to the <b>Enumeration In Progress</b> state will
 happen.</p>
 </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>
 <p>Enumeration In Progress</p>
 </td>
 <td>
 <p>This state indicates the IIpamEnumeratorCallback is
 ready to receive the data.</p>
 <p>When the EnumeratedRowsCallback is received in this
 state from the IIpamEnumerator server port on the management server-end of
 the session, the state will continue to be in <b>Enumeration In Progress</b>.
 </p>
 <p>When the NotifyEnumerationComplete is received in this
 state from the IIpamEnumerator server port on the management server-end of
 the session, the state will transition to <b>Enumeration Completed</b>.</p>
 </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>
 <p>Enumeration Completed</p>
 </td>
 <td>
 <p>This is the state to notify the enumeration
 interaction between the IIpamEnumerator server port on the management
 server-end and the IIpamEnumeratorCallback server port on the management
 client-end is complete and the full data or result is available.</p>
