<p>The following figure shows the state machine of the
IIpamEnumerator server port type.</p>

<p><b>Figure 7: IIpamAsyncProvision server state machine</b></p>

<p>The IIpamAsyncProvision server is session-based and stateful
in nature. The <b>session state</b> variable will be used to keep track of the
current state for each session and it can have the following states as possible
values. At any point of the session, if the session is known to be faulted or
closed by the lower layer, the state machine ends.</p>

<table>
 <thead>
 <tr>
 <th>
 <p>State</p>
 </th>
 <th>
 <p>Description</p>
 </th>
 </tr>
 </thead>
 <tr>
 <td>
 <p>Session Initialized</p>
 </td>
 <td>
 <p>This would be the initial state of the session when it
 has been indicated from the lower layer of the protocol.</p>
 <p>When in this state, when the
 InitializeAsyncProvisioning operation is invoked (by the client), the state
 is changed to <b>Provisioning Initialized</b>. </p>
 </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>
 <p>Provisioning Initialized</p>
 </td>
 <td>
 <p>This would be the state when the provisioning is
 initialized and ready to start the processing.</p>
 <p>When in this state, the StartAsyncProvisioning
 operation request is received from the management client, the server invokes
 the NotifyAsyncProvisionStart callback operation and triggers the
 provisioning. The state is changed to <b>Provisioning Started</b>.</p>
 </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>
 <p>Provisioning Started</p>
 </td>
 <td>
 <p>This state denotes the provisioning has been
 initialized successfully and the provisioning is currently in progress.</p>
 <p>If there is a checkpoint available to be sent across
 from the enumeration processing, the NotifyAsyncProvisionCheckpoint operation
 is invoked and the state is changed to <b>Provisioning In Progress</b>.</p>
 <p>When the provisioning has completed successfully, the
 NotifyAsyncProvisionComplete operation is invoked and the state is changed to
 <b>Provisioning Completed</b>. </p>
 <p>When the provisioning has failed to complete with some
 error, the NotifyAsyncProvisionComplete is called to provide the fault
 information to the client and the state is changed to <b>Provisioning
 Completed</b>.</p>
 </td>
 </tr>

 <p>Provisioning In Progress</p>

 required in the session and proceeds to close the session itself.</p>
