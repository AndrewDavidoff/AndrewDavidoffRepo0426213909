<p>This procedure can be used to delete a hierarchy of address
blocks starting with the block with a particular record identifier. The input
parameters for this are as follows:</p>

<p><b>Param_BlockId: </b> The <b>RecordId</b> of the
block whose entire chain of the hierarchy has to be deleted.</p>

<p><b>Param_addressfamily: </b> The address family to
specify the table against which the block deletion has to be performed.</p>

<p>There are no output parameters for this procedure. The rows
belonging to the entire child block hierarchy is removed.</p>

<p>The following are the steps involved. If the <i>Param_addressfamily</i>
is InterNetwork, the following processing is done against the IPv4-specific
table. Otherwise the following processing is done against the IPv6-specific
table.</p>

<ol><li><p><span> </span>Delete the rows
in <b>ADM_IPBlocksTable</b> whose ParentBlockRecordId is the same as <i>Param_BlockId</i>
by calling the DeleteBlockTree and passing the row.RecordId and <i>Param_addressfamily</i>
as parameters.</p>

</li><li><p><span> </span>Delete the block
with <b>RecordId</b> being <i>Param_BlockId</i>.</p>

</li><li><p><span> </span>Delete the
AccessScopeAssociation entry for this block by calling the DeleteAssociationEntry
procedure of <b>ADM_AccessScopeAssociationTable</b> and passing the following
parameters:</p>

<ul><li><p><span><span> </span></span><i>Param_objectId</i>
is set to <i>Param_blockId</i>.</p>

</li><li><p><span><span> </span></span><i>Param_objectType</i>
is set to IpamObjectType.IPv4Block if addressfamily is InterNetwork or
IpamObjectType.IPv6Block if addressfamily is InterNetworkv6.</p>
