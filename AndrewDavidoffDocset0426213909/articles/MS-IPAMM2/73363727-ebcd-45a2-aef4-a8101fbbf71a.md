<p>The following figure shows the state machine of the
IIpamAsyncSchemaCallback server port type.</p>

<p><b>Figure 11: IIpamAsyncSchemaCallback state machine</b></p>

<p>The IIpamAsyncSchemaCallback server is session-based sharing
the same session the management client has with the management server using the
IIpamAsyncSchemaConversion port type. It is also stateful in nature. The <b>session
state</b> variable will be used to keep track of the current state for each
session and it can have the following states as possible values. At any point
of the session, if the session is known to be faulted or closed by the lower
layer, the state machine ends.</p>

<table>
 <thead>
 <tr>
 <th>
 <p>State</p>
 </th>
 <th>
 <p>Description</p>

 <tr>
 <td>
 <p>Conversion Callback Initialized</p>
 </td>
 <td>
 <p>This is the initial state of the
 IIpamAsyncSchemaCallback will be when it has been initialized by the
 IIpamAsyncSchemaConversion client.</p>
 <p>When the NotifyAsyncSchemaConversionStart is received
 in this state from the IIpamAsyncSchemaConversion server port on the
 management server-end of the session, the transition to the <b>Conversion In
 Progress</b> state will happen.</p>
 </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>
 <p>Conversion In Progress</p>
 </td>
 <td>
 <p>This state indicates the IIpamAsyncSchemaCallback is
 ready to receive the schema conversion checkpoint and completion status.</p>
 <p>When the NotifyAsyncSchemaConversionCheckpoint is
 received in this state from the IIpamAsyncSchemaConversion server port on the
 management server-end of the session, the state will continue to be in <b>Conversion
 In Progress</b>. </p>
 <p>When the NotifyAsyncSchemaConversionComplete is
 received in this state from the IIpamAsyncSchemaConversion server port on the
 management server-end of the session, the state will transition to <b>Conversion
 Completed</b>.</p>
 </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>
 <p>Conversion Completed</p>
 </td>
 <td>
 <p>This is the state to notify the schema conversion
 status interaction between the IIpamAsyncSchemaConversion server port on the
 management server-end and the IIpamAsyncSchemaCallback server port on the
 management client-end is complete and the result is available.</p>
