<p>This section describes a conceptual model of possible data
organization that an implementation maintains to participate in this protocol.
The described organization is provided to facilitate the explanation of how the
protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations adhere to
this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described
in this document.</p>

<p>The following state is available on a per-session basis:</p>

<p><b>ConversionFault</b>: This contains the IpamException
having the fault that the server has sent across to the client or any session
establishment failure fault that the lower transport layer might have
indicated. If this value is set, the schema conversion is considered
unsuccessful. If this value is not set, the schema conversion is considered
successful.</p>
