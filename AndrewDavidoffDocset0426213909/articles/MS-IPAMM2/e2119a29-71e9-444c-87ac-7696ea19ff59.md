<p>This section describes a conceptual model of possible data
organization that an implementation maintains to participate in this protocol.
The described organization is provided to facilitate the explanation of how the
protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations adhere to
this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described
in this document.</p>

<p>The following state is available on a per-session basis.</p>

<p><b>EnumerationInfo</b>: This is a compound data
consisting of the following three portions. This will have the complete
information regarding the enumeration â€“ the data if it has completed
successfully or not, and the failure information if it has failed.</p>

<p><b>EnumeratedData</b>: This is a collection of
IpamObject type (or any type extending the IpamObjectType). At the end of the
successful enumeration completion, this will have the data enumerated.</p>

<p><b>EnumerationResult</b>: This is of type IpamObject
(or any type extending the IpamObjectType). At the end of the successful
enumeration completion, this will have any additional data pertaining to the
enumeration.</p>

<p><b>EnumerationFault</b>: This contains the
IpamException having the fault that the server has sent across to the client or
any session establishment failure fault that the lower transport layer might
have indicated. If this value is set, the enumeration is considered
unsuccessful. If this value is not set, the enumeration is considered
successful. In this case, EnumeratedData and EnumeratedResult are considered
valid.</p>
